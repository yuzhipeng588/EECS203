%% Problem 1
% Simulation and Linearization of Engine/Drivetrain model

%% 1(a)
% Plot Throttle characteristic

%% 1(b)
% Rewrite equations in state-variable form.  Nothing to include in script
% file.  If desired, can enter equations using LaTex.

%% 1(c)
% |hcModel| is autograded.  This section can make small illustration of its
% behavior.

%% 1(d)
% |hcEqPt| is autograded.  Nothing to include in script file here.  Problem
% 1(f) below carries out linearization at 2 specific speeds.

%% 1(e)
% Based on Throttle characteristic, and maximum value of |T|, what is
% maximum equilibrium speed car?  Use this section to make the simple
% calculation.

%% 1(f)
% Illustrate the results of |hcEqPt| at |vBar=22| and |vBar=32|

%% 1(g)
% |constantThrottleSim| is autograded.   In this section, carry out the
% simulations, and format the plots nicely.

%% 1(h)
% |sinusoidThrottleSim| is autograded.   In this section, carry out the
% simulations, and format the plots nicely.

%% 1(i)
% |hcLinearModel| is autograded.   Nothing to include in script file here.
% This section can make small illustration of its behavior. 

%% 1(j)
% Illustrate the results of |hcLinearModel| at |vBar=22| and |vBar=32|

%% 1(k)
% |constantThrottleLinearSim| is autograded.  In this section, carry out
% the simulations, and format the plots nicely.

%% 1(l)
% |sinusoidalThrottleLinearSim| is autograded.  In this section, carry out
% the simulations, and format the plots nicely.

%% Problem 2
% Stability of specific discrete-time system.  |isSystemStable| is
% autograded.   Illustrate its behavior here for a few values of |alpha|

%% Problem 3
% Modeling an Euler-discretization of building heat transfer model

%% 3(a)
% |bldgHTM| is autograded.  Illustrate its behavior here.

%% 3(b)
% Add code here to carry out the |ode45| simulation, including relevant
% plots.

%% 3(c)
% Add code here to carry out the first-order, forward Euler simulation,
% including relevant plots, and comparison to |ode45| simulation.

%% Problem 4
% Kinematic Bicycle model, simulation and animation

%% 4(a)
% |bikeFE| is autograded.  Illustrate its behavior here.

%% 4(b)
% |bikeFEsim| is autograded.  Illustrate its behavior here, including a few
% plots.  Data produced in this section will be used in the next section to
% build the animation.

%% 4(c)
% Include code here to produce the animation, mimicing the ideas in the
% |movingLineMovieDemo.m| file introduced in Lab.

%% Attribution
% Include you name, date and the class number.
